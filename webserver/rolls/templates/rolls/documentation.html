                            <h4>Analysis of overall survival</h4>
                            <p>The analysis presented involves the investigation of overall survival (OS) data using Kaplan-Meier survival curves and log-rank tests to evaluate the association between gene, miRNA, and protein expression levels with patient outcomes. Specifically, OS data provided by The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) is used as time-to-event information. The survival time, expressed in days, measures the duration from diagnosis or treatment initiation until the event of interest, such as death or last follow-up.</p>
                            <p>The expression data used are Gene Expression Quantification HTSeq - FPKM, miRNA Expression Quantification and Protein Expression Quantification</p>
                            <p><b>Choice of Time Variables:</b>Users have the flexibility to select the time variable for the analysis based on their specific research needs. The two available options are:</p>
                                <ol>
                                    <li><strong>OS.time:</strong> This variable uses overall survival time data as the primary measure for the time-to-event analysis.</li>
                                    <li><strong>DFI.time:</strong> This variable utilizes disease-free interval time data, which reflects the duration from diagnosis to the first occurrence of disease recurrence or progression.</li>
                                </ol>
                                <p>The choice between these two time variables can impact the survival analysis results and their interpretations, allowing users to tailor the analysis to their research objectives.</p>

                            <p>The analysis consists of several key components:</p>
                            <p><b>1. Kaplan-Meier Survival Curves:</b> Kaplan-Meier estimators are used to compute the survival probabilities over time for patients stratified by their expression levels. For each gene, miRNA, or protein, patients are divided into two groups: those with expression levels above the median (higher expression) and those below the median (lower expression). The survival curves for each group are plotted to visualize differences in survival probabilities over time.</p>
                        
                            <p><b>2. Log-Rank Test:</b> To statistically compare the survival distributions between the higher and lower expression groups, the log-rank test is employed. This test assesses whether there are significant differences in overall survival between the two groups, with the resulting p-value indicating the level of statistical significance.</p>
                            <p><b>3. Survival Time in Days:</b> The x-axis of the Kaplan-Meier plot represents the time in days, reflecting the OS data. The y-axis displays the survival probability, which represents the conditional probability of surviving beyond a given time point.</p>
                            <p><b>4. Expression Level Impact on Survival:</b> By linking the OS data to gene, miRNA, and protein expression levels, this analysis aims to identify potential biomarkers of survival, providing insights into the biological mechanisms driving cancer progression and patient prognosis.</p>

                            <br>
                            <p>This integrative approach combining transcriptomic, proteomic, and survival data allows for a comprehensive assessment of how molecular alterations impact patient outcomes, potentially guiding personalized cancer therapies and improving prognostic predictions.</p>

                            <p>This analysis offers the opportunity to perform an overall survival analysis by going to study instead of the expression of a single gene, the expression of a set of genes (pathways).
                            <br><br>The analysis for a given tumor consists of dividing samples into two groups based on pathway activity score (PAS) values pre-calculated with <a href='https://bioconductor.org/packages/devel/bioc/vignettes/GSVA/inst/doc/GSVA.html' target="_blank">GSVA</a> (Gene Set Variation Analysis).
                            The PAS describes how active that pathway is in that given sample. GSVA is a nonparametric, unsupervised method for estimating the variation in gene set enrichment across samples in an expression dataset.
